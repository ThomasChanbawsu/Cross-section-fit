# Cross-section-fit
The first python project required in my introduction to programming course in the UoM physics course


In this assignment, we were required to filter, analyse and plot given experimental data of the counts of Z boson over different energies (in GeV) to obtain a resonance graph. Through this, The mass of the Z boson and it's lifetime were accurately determined with the aid of a best fit. 
The fit was optimised based on a 2D chi-square analysis and minimization routine. The 2D chi-square was analysed due to our uncertainties with two parameters, in this case the mass and width of the Z boson.
